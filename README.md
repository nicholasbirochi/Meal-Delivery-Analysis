# Meal Delivery Orders Analysis — Pandas & NumPy

This project applies **Pandas** and **NumPy** to analyze real meal delivery order data.
You will work with two datasets (orders and menu) to extract business insights through EDA, feature engineering, missing data handling, aggregations, time analysis, dataset merge, filters, and KPIs.

## Project goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer new features (item revenue)
- Handle missing values (fill + drop strategy)
- Aggregate results by item and category
- Analyze trends over time
- Calculate core business KPIs (NumPy)
- (Optional) Compute percentiles with NumPy

## Datasets

This project expects two CSV files inside the `data/` folder:

- `data/pedidos.csv`
  - `Data` (order date)
  - `Item` (ordered item)
  - `Quantidade` (quantity)
  - `Preco_Unitario` (charged unit price)
  - plus identifiers like `ID_Pedido`, `Cliente_ID`
- `data/cardapio.csv`
  - `Item`
  - `Categoria` (Salgados, Bebidas, Sobremesas/Doces, etc.)
  - `Preco_Base` (base price)

### macOS extraction note (important)

If you extracted the datasets on macOS, your zip may also contain:
- `data/__MACOSX/`
- `data/__MACOSX/._pedidos.csv`
- `data/__MACOSX/._cardapio.csv`

These are **metadata artifacts** and should be ignored.
(Recommended: add `__MACOSX/` and `._*` to your `.gitignore`.)

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (basic chart)

## How to run

1) Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

2) Open the notebook in Jupyter / Google Colab / VS Code Notebook.

3) Ensure your project structure matches the following (or adjust the paths inside the notebook):

```text
   .
   ├── main.ipynb
   ├── README.md
   └── data/
       ├── pedidos.csv
       ├── cardapio.csv
       └── __MACOSX/ (optional; ignore)
           ├── ._pedidos.csv
           └── ._cardapio.csv
```

4) Run the notebook cells in order.

## What the notebook delivers

- `Receita_Item` = `Quantidade * Preco_Unitario`
- Missing values report and cleaning
- Item-level aggregation:
  - total quantity sold
  - total revenue
  - top 5 items by quantity and by revenue
- Time analysis:
  - revenue by month
  - trend plot
- Merge with menu data:
  - revenue by category
  - top revenue category
- Filters:
  - category == 'Salgados' and quantity > 10
- KPIs (NumPy):
  - Total Revenue
  - Total Items Sold
  - Average Ticket (Total Revenue / number of orders)
  - (Optional) percentiles for unit price and quantity
